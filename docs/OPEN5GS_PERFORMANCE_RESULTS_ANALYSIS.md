## Performance Analysis

### Open5gs

**syscount: Syscalls and system processes analysis**

We start by analysis the syscall counts across the system and related process, as well as their latency information. This is very useful for general workload characterization. To get all the available syscalls `sudo python3 syscount.py --list`

Yes, I can. According to 1 and 2, system calls can be grouped roughly into five or six major categories:

Process control: create, terminate, load, execute, get/set process attributes, wait for time/event, signal event, allocate and free memory
File management: create, open, close, delete, read/write file
Device management: request/release device access, read/write device
Information maintenance: get/set system time/date/attributes
Communication: create/delete communication connection, send/receive messages

Services Provided by System Calls :

Process creation and management
Main memory management
File Access, Directory and File system management
Device handling(I/O)
Protection
Networking, etc.

Types of System Calls : There are 5 different categories of system calls â€“

1. Process control: end, abort, create, terminate, allocate and free memory.
2. File management: create, open, close, delete, read file etc.
3. Device management
4. Information maintenance
5. Communication

We first ran syscalls analysis for an idle system, not receiving any traffic.

```bash
ansible all -i inventory.ini -u ubuntu -m include_tasks -a file=plays/open5gs.yml \
    -e '{ user: ubuntu,  duration: 20, aduration: 35, interval: 0, tool_cmd: "syscount.py -d 20 -L -m -j", tool: syscount, ues: 0 }'
```

We ran the same too on an idle `m1.large` instance and got more or less the same results. The details of the flavous are:
* m2.medium: RAM 4096 |  Disk 50 | vCPU 2
* m1.large: RAM 8192 |  Disk 80 | vCPU 4

**Process making system calls**

We then looked at the processes making these system calls on the idle system.

```bash
ansible all -i inventory.ini -u ubuntu -m include_tasks -a file=plays/open5gs.yml \
    -e '{ user: ubuntu,  duration: 20, aduration: 35, interval: 0, tool_cmd: "syscount.py -d 20 -L -P -m -j", tool: sysprocess, ues: 0 }'
```

**futex**

The open5gs has a lot of futex system calls. Once one the reasons for high futex system calls on VM is high contention on shared-memory resources that causes many threads to wait on futexes <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/534663">source</a>. Therefore a lot of futex system calls on a VM may indicate that there is a lot of concurrent access to shared resources or data structures by multiple threads or processes. Ran the analysis on open5gs system that is not receiving an traffic and we still got active or a lot of syscalls. To get a visibility of the processes producing the futex syscalls we ran `sudo python3 syscount.py --syscall futex -L -P -d 2`, this gave is the results below.

For a system not receiving traffic, this points the source of the futex system calls being high contention on shared-memory resources. To reduce this we will need to run the open5gs system on a larger instance.

- [ ] TODO: Verify source of high futex - compare performance of open5gs on different VM instances. Can also compare on hardware server.

**epoll_wait**

The system also has a large epoll_wait system calls when receiving traffic. The possible reasons for this are:

1. You have more file descriptors ready than the maxevents parameter you passed to epoll_wait, and the system call is round-robin through them.
2. You have a signal handler that interrupts epoll_wait and causes it to return with an error code (EINTR). You may need to check for this error and retry the system call.
- To confirm this we ran `sudo python3 syscount.py -x --d 2` which gives a list of failed system calls. epoll_wait was not on the list. Also ran `sudo python3 syscount.py -e EINTR --d 2` to check for processes failing with the above error, of which none were failing.
3. You have a problem with timer handling or scheduling latency across system suspend or resume, which may trigger a watchdog logic that aborts epoll_wait https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/23032
4. A lot of epoll_wait system calls on a VM may indicate that there is a lot of I/O activity on the VM or that the timeout value for epoll_wait is too low.

```bash
ansible all -i inventory.ini -u ubuntu -m include_tasks -a file=plays/open5gs.yml \
    -e '{ user: ubuntu,  duration: 20, aduration: 35, interval: 0, tool_cmd: "syscount.py --syscall epoll_wait -d 20 -L -P -m -j", tool: sysprocess_epoll_wait, ues: 0 }'

To understand `sudo python3 tplist.py | grep epoll_wait` and then `sudo python3 tplist.py -v syscalls:sys_enter_epoll_wait`

`sudo python3 argdist.py -C 't:syscalls:sys_exit_epoll_wait():u16:args->ret' -i 5 -d 5`

<details><summary>Click to see results for further investigating the epoll_wait syscalls</summary>

One of the reasons can be that timeouts for epoll_wait are low. This means that the it reaches timeouts when there are few or no events to poll in most cases. To get visibility of this we run inspect the `sys_enter_epoll_wait` and `sys_exit_epoll_wait` tracepoint to trace the value of timeout on most of the epoll_wait syscalls and the number of events to be polled respectively.

We start by using the helper tool `tplist.py` to get more information on the tracepoints `sudo python3 tplist.py | grep epoll_wait` can help filter all the epoll_wait related tracepoints. The commands `sudo python3 tplist.py -v syscalls:sys_enter_epoll_wait` and `sudo python3 tplist.py -v syscalls:sys_exit_epoll_wait` will print the arguments passed to these tracepoint (which are the values we want to inspect).

We start by looking at the value of timeouts using as below

```bash
ansible all -i inventory.ini -u ubuntu -m include_tasks -a file=plays/open5gs.yml \
    -e "{ user: ubuntu,  duration: 20, aduration: 35, interval: 0, tool_cmd: \"argdist.py -C 't:syscalls:sys_enter_epoll_wait():u16:args->timeout' -i 20 -d 20\", tool: sysprocess_enter_epoll_wait_timeout, ues: 0 }"
```

The results from the above were

	25         args->timeout = 1000
	33         args->timeout = 0
```

We then looked at the exit to get the number of events to be polled on every poll exit

```bash
ansible all -i inventory.ini -u ubuntu -m include_tasks -a file=plays/open5gs.yml \
    -e "{ user: ubuntu,  duration: 20, aduration: 35, interval: 0, tool_cmd: \"argdist.py -C 't:syscalls:sys_exit_epoll_wait():u16:args->ret' -i 20 -d 20\", tool: sysprocess_exit_epoll_wait, ues: 0 }"
```

The results from above were

```
[10:11:31]
t:syscalls:sys_exit_epoll_wait():u16:args->ret
	COUNT      EVENT
	1          args->ret = 3
	1          args->ret = 4
	1          args->ret = 5
	2          args->ret = 6
	5          args->ret = 2
	84         args->ret = 0
	136        args->ret = 1
```

We can see that for the given timeouts in most cases the number of events to be polled were 0 or 1. This is major because we were collecting the results for an idle system. The `epoll_wait` is mainly used for busy systems. In the case were the system is idle it is a 'waste' of resources. However, the system was not meant for cases where it is idle.

In order to get a better evalution of the system usage of the `epoll_wait` we need to  run the test when the system is not idle.

When there are 90 UEs

```
t:syscalls:sys_exit_epoll_wait():u16:args->ret
	COUNT      EVENT
	1          args->ret = 6
	10         args->ret = 5
	41         args->ret = 4
	193        args->ret = 3
	868        args->ret = 2
	1674       args->ret = 0
	13770      args->ret = 1
```

**recvmsg**

The recvmsg system call is used to receive messages from a socket, and may be used to receive data on a socket. The syscall is used whether or not it is connection-oriented.

```bash

**clock_nanosleep**

clock_nanosleep system calls are functions that allow a thread to sleep for a specified time interval with nanosecond precision <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/clock_nanosleep.2.en">source</a>. clock_nanosleep are mainly used by processes to manage their resources and avoid blocking other threads or processes. We see that the main processes using clock_nanosleep are `mongod` and `multipathd`.

`mongod` is a process that runs MongoDB, a cross-platform document-oriented database system and `multipathd` is a daemon that monitors and manages multipath devices on Linux systems. Multipath devices are virtual devices that combine multiple physical connections between a server and a storage array into one logical device

```bash
ansible all -i inventory.ini -u ubuntu -m include_tasks -a file=plays/open5gs.yml \
    -e '{ user: ubuntu,  duration: 20, aduration: 35, interval: 0, tool_cmd: "syscount.py --syscall clock_nanosleep -d 20 -L -P -m -j", tool: sysprocess_clock_nanosleep, ues: 0 }'

## System call categorisation

System calls can be grouped roughly into five major categories:

- Process control: These system calls perform the task of process creation, termination, execution, loading, etc. They also handle memory allocation and deallocation for processes.
- File management: These system calls handle file manipulation jobs like creating, opening, closing, deleting, reading, writing, renaming files and directories. They also manage file attributes and permissions.
- Device management: These system calls do the job of requesting and releasing access to devices such as disks, printers, scanners, etc. They also control device functions such as reading and writing data from or to devices.
- Information maintenance: These system calls provide information about various system resources such as time, date, user identity, process status, etc. They also allow modifying some system parameters such as priority levels.
- Communication: These system calls enable processes to communicate with each other using various methods such as message passing or shared memory. They also support network communication using sockets or pipes.

To see the list of system calls on Linux run `sudo python3 syscount.py --list`.
